powergremlin
============

Powergremlin provides iOS6 device power usage measurements.

It only runs on iOS6+. You'll need XCode4.2+ and a valid iOS developer account to run the code on your phone. The code itself has no external dependencies. To get started just do something like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/palominolabs/powergremlin.git powergremlin
cd powergremlin
open PowerGremlin.xcodeproj
```

Then connect an iOS device and run!
